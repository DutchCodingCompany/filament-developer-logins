# Upgrading

## Upgrading from 1.x to 2.x

Version 2.x supports filament 4.x and is not compatible with filament 3.x. Below are the breaking changes:

- The [columns](https://github.com/DutchCodingCompany/filament-developer-logins/tree/1.10.0?tab=readme-ov-file#columns) feature has been removed. If you were using it you need to remove it from the plugin configuration.

That's it! If you find any bugs please let me know.
